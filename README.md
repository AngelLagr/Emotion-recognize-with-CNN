The goal of this project was to create a model that can detect the emotion of a given face. I used what I learned with my current studies and a Data bank from this vidéo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoCIoumbWQY&ab_channel=ProgresswithPython

I'm currently filling my validation data, but for now the result is quite intersting but not perfect at all !!
